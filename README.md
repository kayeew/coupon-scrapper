## Motivation:
As a student, I'm always looking for great lunch deals 
and its such a hassle to visit each fast food chain website to look for deals. 
So I thought why not make a site that can scraps deals from all the fast food chain websites with just a click of a button.

## Setup Instructions:
- Clone or download project
- "cd" into project folder, then "npm install" on cmd
- npm start
